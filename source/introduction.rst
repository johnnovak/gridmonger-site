A few years ago, I decided to play some old-school dungeon crawlers that I had
missed out on as kid, so I started looking for some software tool to replace
traditional pen-and-paper mapping. Unfortunately, none of the readily
available solutions were to my liking.  Spreadsheet applications (a popular
choice among many RPG enthusiasts) are too fiddly and slow to work with, and
the dungeon mapping tools I could find were either overcomplicated, too
barebones, unattractive, or just didn't have the type of keyboard-driven
interface I was looking for.

And that last point is the critical one. An RPG with say ten 32Ã—32 dungeons
has 10,240 cells in total. On average, only about 30--50% of those are cells
that you can actually visit---but that's still 3,000--5,000 little squares to
map during the course of a single playthrough. You can easily spend 20-40
hours to complete a classic RPG, and often much longer! Because of this, it's
reasonable to expect the same level of efficiency and ergonomics from your
dungeon mapping tool that you would from any professional editing
software.

When designing Gridmonger, my main goal was to make map creation as much an
efficient and enjoyable experience as possible. The basic idea was simple:
classic cRPGs are keyboard driven, therefore the mapping tool has to be
keyboard driven as well. Ideally, you would not even have to lift your fingers
from the keyboard while simultaneously playing and mapping the game!

Let me stress this again: Gridmonger is meant to be used *while playing the
game*. While other programs might bedazzle you with a large variety of
features, Gridmonger's scope is small and focused on purpose. It aims to do
one thing, and do it well: be the ultimate mapping companion for grid-based
cRPG games.

I hope you will have as much fun using Gridmonger as I had writing it!
