Before continuing with editing, let's quickly have a look at the preferences
settings.

Press :kbd:`Ctrl+Alt+U` to bring up the preferences dialog. On the **Startup**
tab you have the option to toggle the displaying of the splash screen, and to
have it auto-closed after a set number of seconds.

Another important option is the **Load last map** toggle. This is enabled by
default, so you can continue from where you left off after starting the program.

On the **General** tab you can set the autosave settings. By default, the map
gets automatically saved every two minutes. This is great in general, but you
need to be aware of it in order not to accidentally lose data (e.g. by
deleting half of your levels, then autosave kicks in, and then you quit the
program). Also, if you're going to experiment with the editing functions on
the included example maps, it's best to either turn autosave off, or create
backup copies of the map files first.

Finally, you have the option to **Enable vertical sync**. The program does its
drawing just like a game engine; it's locked to your desktop refresh rate if
vertical sync is on. Disabling it may increase the responsiveness of the UI,
but at the cost of potentially much higher CPU consumption. Generally, you
should leave it on.
