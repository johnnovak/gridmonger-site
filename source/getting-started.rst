Getting started

Like most worthwhile things in life, Gridmonger is *not* instant
gratification.  To paraphrase the famous quote about Linux:

*Gridmonger is definitely user-friendly, but it's perhaps a tad more
selective about its friends than your average desktop app.*

But, alas, worry not --- if you are a fan of oldschool computer role-playing
games, and you are able to set them up in emulators, you will get along with
Gridmonger just fine.

The user interface is optimised for power users, and therefore is operable by
keyboard shortcuts almost exclusively. While you could get quite far going by
the list of :ref:`appendixes/keyboard-shortcuts:Keyboard shortcuts` alone, the
more complex features would be a bit hard to figure out on your own.  I very
much recommend to work your way through this manual to familiarise
yourself with the full list of program features. It's written in
a conversational style, as an attempt to make it more to fun to read than
a typical reference manual.

Having said all that, some people are just impatient, or want to get a taste
of the program before committing to reading the documentation. For them,
I have included a few quick tips in the :ref:`getting-started:quickstart`
section.
