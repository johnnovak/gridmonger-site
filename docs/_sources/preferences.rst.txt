Before continuing with editing, let's quickly have a look at the preferences
settings.

Press :kbd:`Ctrl+Alt+U` to bring up the preferences dialog. On the **Startup**
tab you have the option to toggle the displaying of the splash screen, and to
have it auto-closed after a set number of seconds.

Another important setting is the **Load last map** option. This is enabled by
default, so you can continue from where you left off after starting the
program again.

On the **General** tab you will find the autosave settings. By default, the
map gets automatically saved every two minutes. This is great in general, but
you need to exercise some caution in order not to accidentally lose your work
(e.g. by deleting some levels, then autosave kicks in, and then you quit the
program, which won't display a warning at this point because the changes have
already been saved...) Also, if you're going to experiment with the editing
functions on the included example maps, it's best to either turn autosave off,
or create backup copies of the example maps first.

Finally, you have the option to **Enable vertical sync**. The program does its
drawing just like a game engine; it's locked to your desktop refresh rate if
vertical sync is on. Disabling it may increase the responsiveness of the UI,
but at the cost of potentially much higher CPU consumption. Generally, you
should leave it on.
